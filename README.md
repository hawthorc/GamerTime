<h1>Co-op Multiplayer Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a cooperative multiplayer video game, written in Java without using a game engine. As such, all game and networking logic, file structures, and assets are created from scratch, in an effort to learn more about what it takes to develop a complete software project.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Java</b>
- <b><a href="https://eclipseide.org/">Eclipse IDE</a></b>

<h2>Example usage / gameplay:</h2>

This repository includes a file named "test.jar". To get started, download the file:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then, you can run the file via the command line, or by double-clicking to execute (Windows). NOTE: You'll need to install the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment.

You should be met with the game's main menu. Use the arrow keys / WASD to navigate, and Enter to select one of the three options:

<br/>
"Start game" will begin a solo session. To connect to another player, choose "start server". This should result in a message noting the address at which a connection was opened:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Next, the other player can select "join server" and enter the first player's address into the resulting prompt:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once the game has started, each player can move with arrow keys or WASD. Player 1 is purple, and Player 2 is gold. You can open doors by picking up keys, allowing you to access new areas.
